# copper-components

## Abstract

Take the AmplifyJS web-components and wire them for use with an opinioned `<app-header>`.

## Problem Statement

There is little support for web-components when learning AmplifyJs. As a result the overall adoption rate of web-components is assumed to be lower do to lack of exposure and understanding. Maybe developers write poor front end code and many others shy away from front end technologies completely. An attempt should be made to flatten the learning curve surrounding solutions within the webb application space.

## Proposed Solution

`Copper-Components` will provide a simple starter project as well as maintain a library of examples.
